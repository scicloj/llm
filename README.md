# llm

# allows to ask questions to GPT2 in pure Clojure

VERY DRAFT !!!

# instructions 
- Requires that "gpt2-lm-head-bs-12.onnx" exists in root directory
- You can download from here:
https://huggingface.co/onnxmodelzoo/gpt2-lm-head-bs-12

- It only works with this model so far.

- I tested it on CPU only

- it requires that "deep diamond" works in your setup
   - might need changes in deps.edn

- the provided devcontainer has it working

- current 'deps.edn' probably only work on Linux + CPU
